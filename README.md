## About us
PixelBot is a team of developers and testers creating bots for **PixelPlace**. We don't necessarily work on the same project together, but we cooperate and help each other with our personal projects. 

## Projects
|Project Name|  Created by| Used for | 
|--|--| --| 
| PythonBot | Dukekero | ARTS bot, authenticating and communicating with PixelPlace| 
| PythonPPCommunicator | Dukekero (& AlmosYT) | Communicating with PixelPlace and a local TCP server| 
| CSharpBot | AlmosYT | Bot with a User Interface, eventually a full-fledged client for PixelPlace|
